This branch is intended for testing new methods for fitting spectral components of narrow line regions.

Download SpecData.ipynb , DescargaFITS.ipynb , LinesAll.txt , DefSD.py , and the folder /LIST1

DescargaFITS.ipynb allows download a list of objects given in a list : /LIST1/listR.txt

Specdata.ipynb contains the basic functions for read, plotting and fitting the given spectrum in the lines (LinesAll.txt).

Diagnostic diagrams of electron density and temperature can be done according to the Diagnostics Class of PyNeb. More information: [PyNeb's Home Page](http://www.iac.es/proyecto/PyNeb/)
